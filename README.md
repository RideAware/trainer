# RideAware Trainer Application

**Status: Work in Progress**

This README provides a brief overview of the RideAware Trainer Application. Please note that this project is currently under active development, and the information provided below is subject to change. This document will be updated with more detailed information as the application progresses.

## Overview

The RideAware Trainer Application serves as a streamlined and immediate access point for users to engage with their planned workouts. Users will have the option to either select a pre-defined workout or load their specific plan from the day

A key feature of the RideAware Trainer Application is its seamless integration with the RideAware Calendar. Users will be able to launch the Trainer Application directly from the Calendar when selecting the workout they want to do for that day, automatically loading the training planned for that day.

**Important:** All training plans are created and managed within the core RideAware platform. The Trainer Application serves solely as a streamlined way for users to load the day's RideAware calendar workout or select from a subset of training plans

## Features (Planned)

The following features are planned for future releases of the RideAware Trainer Application:

*   **Launch from RideAware Calendar:** Load your RideAware calendar workout for the day or select from a subset of training plans
